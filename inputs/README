This folder can be used to place inputs that may be expected by the project.

Obviously the project could be configured to look for input data in an external folder as well, but placing it inside
the package has its benefits, e.g. enabling one to create a standalone python-executable zipfile which contains the data
required already.

Note that this folder is simply a convention. If you plan to use it, you should probably reflect this in your CONFIG.py
file appropriately as well!
