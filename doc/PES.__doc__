The PES Pandemic Emergency Scenario is an experimental paradigm designed to 
investigate the Wisdom of Crowds effect as an effective group-decision making
tool, in the context of non-trivial, non-binary tasks, and hybrid teams consisting
of both human and artificial agents.  We conducted a series of experiments
using this tool, to investigate and understand the conditions under which the
WoC effect can take place in hybrid team contexts, and the potential role of
Brain-Computer Interfaces and neurophysiological markers in augmenting the 
performance of such teams.  The neurophysiological and behavioural information 
is used to improve aggregatio of opinions, leading to optimal performance and 
team cohesion.  Our results showed that artificial agents with 'human' traits, 
such as 'imperfect play' and a 'learning element' in combination with human agents
successfully demonstrated a Wisdom of Crowds effect, achieving higher perfomrance 
than either agent is isolation.
