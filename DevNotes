- I don't think the Enum module is actually used anywhere
- I think the class-based type is a bit overkill in this context, and more prone to error.
- I think it would be preferable to define the type of player (e.g. human vs ai) at the configuration level, for the
  sake of reproducibility. We can keep setting via parameters but preferably as an 'overriding' option for testing. In
  fact, I've used environmental variables in the same way in the past under this kind of scheme.
- I have converted all constants in the config file to uppercase
- I have removed the 'path' variable - it will be substituted with PKGROOT etc in all the right places.
- I have separated the pygame-interfacing functions into a separate pygameMediator module
